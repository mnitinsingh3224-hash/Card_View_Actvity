💡 What I learned:
How to use CardView for material-style components
Applying shadows and corner radius for better depth
Organizing nested layouts for smooth alignment
Designing attractive product cards with image, title, price, and “Add to Cart” button
This was a great step forward in improving my Kotlin + UI/UX skills!
 Excited to build the full shopping app soon. 🛒🔥
